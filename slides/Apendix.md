# Jensen Huang ‚Äì CEO, NVIDIA

> "The days of every line of code being written by software engineers are completely over."

> "Everyone in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence."

> "It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program. And that the programming language is human."

> "Generative AI is closing the technology divide. You don't have to be a C++ programmer to be successful."

# Vibe Coding Requires Vigilance

- Vibe coding may introduce shortcuts  
- AI might pull in PII or misuse data to ‚Äúget the job done‚Äù  
- Code that looks good isn‚Äôt always code that‚Äôs safe  
- Review, guardrails, and governance are non-negotiable  

> *‚ÄúJust because AI *can* solve it, doesn‚Äôt mean it *should* solve it that way.‚Äù*

# Not All Code Is Created Equal

**üéØ Mission-Critical Systems**  
_Defense, Aerospace, Healthcare_  
- Requires formal verification  
- Zero tolerance for failure  
- Governed by strict regulations (e.g., DO-178C, FDA)

**üì¶ Production Applications**  
_Internal tools, customer-facing software_  
- Must be stable, secure, and maintainable  
- Requires testing and code reviews  
- Breakage impacts real users or business ops

**üõ†Ô∏è Developer Utilities**  
_Local scripts, test automation_  
- Built for speed and convenience  
- Often disposable or single-use  
- Lower risk ‚Äî but can still spread bugs if reused

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**

We often talk about AI writing code ‚Äî but the kind of code matters a lot.

- At the bottom are quick-and-dirty developer utilities.
- In the middle, business-critical software where QA matters.
- At the top are systems where failure is not an option.

The higher the risk, the greater the need for **rigor, review, and responsibility** ‚Äî AI should support, not shortcut, those needs.

-->

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**

This diagram shows the hierarchy of software in terms of **risk and responsibility**.

- At the base, scripts are simple and usually only affect the developer.
- In the middle, shared programs must meet standards for other users.
- At the top, mission-critical systems can‚Äôt afford failures ‚Äî lives or national security might be at stake.

So when we say ‚ÄúAI is writing code,‚Äù we need to ask: *which kind?*  
Because the stakes ‚Äî and the consequences ‚Äî are not the same.
