- Enhanced productivity and streamlined the coding process.

<!-- 
Lot's of discussion - software engineering was split
Some were this is amazing and some were not
-->

---

# Jensen Huang - CEO NVIDIA

> "Everyone in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence." — Jensen Huang

— **August 2024**

---
<!-- In the interview December 2024, Nadella elaborated on how AI agents are poised to revolutionize the traditional software model: Esentially he said Agents will replace Software​

-->
# Satia Nadella - CEO Microsoft

> *Satya Nadella: "AI is the runtime that will shape all of what we do"*

— **December 2024**

---
# Eric Schmidt - Former Google CEO

> "We believe as an industry that in the next one year the vast majority of programmers will be replaced by AI programmers."

— **August 2024**

<!-- 

**Speaker Notes:**

Eric Schmidt is the former CEO of Google (2001–2011), where he helped transform the company into a global tech powerhouse. After his CEO tenure, he served as Executive Chairman of Google and then Alphabet Inc., contributing to the company’s growth and strategic vision. He co-founded Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative focused on advancing technology and talent to solve global problems. Eric has also chaired the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.

This quote was made during a talk at **Stanford University on August 15, 2024**. In his remarks, Schmidt discussed the rapid advancement of AI and its implications on software engineering. He highlighted the concept of recursive self-improvement in AI and predicted that AI systems would soon outperform the majority of human programmers. The talk was later removed from public platforms at Schmidt’s request due to its provocative nature.

# Dario Amodei - CEO of Anthropic

> “I think we'll be there in three to six months, where AI is writing 90% of the code.  
> And then, in 12 months, we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of the code.”   

— **March 2025**

<!-- Dario Amodei — Anthropic CEO 

Dario Amodei is the co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, an AI safety and research company best known for creating Claude, a family of large language models. Prior to founding Anthropic in 2021, Dario was VP of Research at OpenAI, where he led the development of GPT-2 and GPT-3. He has a background in physics and machine learning, and has been one of the most vocal advocates for aligning AI systems with human values and ensuring they can be controlled and understood.

This quote was delivered during a panel at the Council on Foreign Relations on March 10, 2025. In it, Dario predicted a near-term future where AI writes 90% or more of all code, with human engineers focused more on high-level goals, design inputs, and oversight rather than the manual construction of software.

# Will AI Replace Me?
<!-- Sam Altmen Recently did a talk on this and we should point to that -->

<!-- 
A bit proacative and right now I would say to use AI effectivly 
you do need a base understanding on how it works and the best
ways to get the most out of it.

I do feel very quickly some of the capabilites will become embedded
into the applications and be a bit more automatic

Like is a voice system that can determine intent and offer up suggestions to a customer service reperesentive to queue up suggestive actions

# Sam Altman – CEO of OpenAI

> "There are sort of two views you can take.  
> You can say, ‘Oh man, it’s doing everything I can do,’  
> or you can say, ‘Look at all the new things I can now do.’"

— **April 2025**

<!-- 

**Speaker Notes:**

Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI and one of the most influential voices in artificial intelligence today. Before leading OpenAI, he was the president of Y Combinator, where he helped fund and mentor a new generation of tech startups. Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015 with the mission to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. Under his leadership, OpenAI launched ChatGPT and the GPT model series, fundamentally reshaping the public and enterprise understanding of AI capabilities.

This quote was delivered during a live interview at **TED2025 in Vancouver on April 11, 2025**. In his remarks, Altman addressed growing concerns about AI taking over human tasks. He framed the moment not as a loss of human agency, but as a transformative leap—where AI becomes a partner that expands what humans can achieve, rather than a replacement for their work.

# Current Pitfalls

- Developing systems that replicate old ways of software development  
- Difficulties with very large codebases 
- Lack of skills in a rapidly evoloving space  

<!--
Corralite the early days of Agile

# Vibe Coding 
(insert image and description)

# Do We Really Care About the Code?

> *"Do we care about the code — or just the outcome?"*

> AI has already shifted part of our mindset — treating code as a temporary utility, not a permanent product.

---
# Do we care about this code?

> AI is already being inserted into code bases and we don't know even what it really does

> ChatGPT is already creating temp code and executing it and we are not inspecting it just caring about the outcome

# Generative AI fully replacing the application

(refer back to Satia Nadella talk)

# The End of \"Tech for Tech’s Sake\"

- Old mentality: \"I just code, not business\"  
- AI needs business context to generate useful output  
- Engineers must understand goals, not just syntax  

> *“In the future, the best engineers won’t just know how to code — they’ll know why the code matters.”*

<!--
Simple tactical stuff I just end up doing it myself the real skill will be understanding the business 
-->

---
# Preparing for the Future

- Learn agentic systems, system thinking, and architecture  
- Embrace change: experimentation and transparency  
- Grow internal champions for AI adoption  

---

# Closing: A Call to Lead

> \"AI is the runtime that is going to shape all of what we do…\" — Satya Nadella

- Will you be a passenger — or help engineer the future?  
- Start learning. Start prompting. Start leading.  

> *“The next chapter of software engineering is being written now — and we’re all holding the pen.”*

---

# Don’t Just Automate the Past—Reimagine the Future

> “It’s like putting a jet engine on a horse-drawn carriage. Sure, it moves faster, but you’re missing the point—the whole vehicle can be reinvented. Generative AI gives us a chance to reimagine how we deliver, not just speed up what we already do.”

---

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**

Too often, companies approach generative AI as a tool to accelerate old, linear processes—just plugging AI into the same waterfall pipeline: requirements, designs, coding, testing, and deployment.

But real transformation comes when we realize we can rebuild the entire vehicle, not just add horsepower to the old one.

Generative AI allows us to move to more agile, feedback-driven delivery models. We can shorten feedback loops, continuously refine requirements and implementation, and focus on outcomes over outputs.

Let’s challenge ourselves and our organizations: Instead of simply making old processes faster, how might we deliver value in entirely new ways—ways that only become possible because of AI?
