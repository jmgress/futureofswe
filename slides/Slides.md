## I. Opening: A World Transformed by AI

> "Everyone in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence." — Jensen Huang

- Generative AI is reshaping every industry  
- Software engineering is both the catalyst and the canvas  
- From code-centric to context-centric

<!-- In the interview December 2024, Nadella elaborated on how AI agents are poised to revolutionize the traditional software model: Esentially he said Agents will replace Software​

# Eric Schmidt - Former Google CEO

> "We believe as an industry that in the next one year the vast majority of programmers will be replaced by AI programmers."

— **August 2024**

<!-- 

**Speaker Notes:**

Eric Schmidt is the former CEO of Google (2001–2011), where he helped transform the company into a global tech powerhouse. After his CEO tenure, he served as Executive Chairman of Google and then Alphabet Inc., contributing to the company’s growth and strategic vision. He co-founded Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative focused on advancing technology and talent to solve global problems. Eric has also chaired the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.

This quote was made during a talk at **Stanford University on August 15, 2024**. In his remarks, Schmidt discussed the rapid advancement of AI and its implications on software engineering. He highlighted the concept of recursive self-improvement in AI and predicted that AI systems would soon outperform the majority of human programmers. The talk was later removed from public platforms at Schmidt’s request due to its provocative nature.

# Dario Amodei - CEO of Anthropic

> “I think we'll be there in three to six months, where AI is writing 90% of the code.  
> And then, in 12 months, we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of the code.”   

— **March 2025**

<!-- Dario Amodei — Anthropic CEO 

Dario Amodei is the co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, an AI safety and research company best known for creating Claude, a family of large language models. Prior to founding Anthropic in 2021, Dario was VP of Research at OpenAI, where he led the development of GPT-2 and GPT-3. He has a background in physics and machine learning, and has been one of the most vocal advocates for aligning AI systems with human values and ensuring they can be controlled and understood.

This quote was delivered during a panel at the Council on Foreign Relations on March 10, 2025. In it, Dario predicted a near-term future where AI writes 90% or more of all code, with human engineers focused more on high-level goals, design inputs, and oversight rather than the manual construction of software.

# Sam Altman – CEO of OpenAI

> "There are sort of two views you can take.  
> You can say, ‘Oh man, it’s doing everything I can do,’  
> or you can say, ‘Look at all the new things I can now do.’"

— **April 2025**

<!-- 

**Speaker Notes:**

Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI and one of the most influential voices in artificial intelligence today. Before leading OpenAI, he was the president of Y Combinator, where he helped fund and mentor a new generation of tech startups. Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015 with the mission to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. Under his leadership, OpenAI launched ChatGPT and the GPT model series, fundamentally reshaping the public and enterprise understanding of AI capabilities.

This quote was delivered during a live interview at **TED2025 in Vancouver on April 11, 2025**. In his remarks, Altman addressed growing concerns about AI taking over human tasks. He framed the moment not as a loss of human agency, but as a transformative leap—where AI becomes a partner that expands what humans can achieve, rather than a replacement for their work.

## II. Then: Traditional Software Engineering

- Waterfall → Agile  
- Developers as deep specialists  
- Manual testing, static IDEs  
- Engineering as craft: precision over speed  

---

## III. Now: The AI-Augmented Engineer

- Tools: Copilot, Cody, Tabnine  
- Prompting over scripting  
- Engineers become editors, validators, and context managers  

---

## IV. Rethinking the Engineering Lifecycle

- Prompt-driven pipelines  
- AI + DevOps: new quality gates and CI/CD patterns  
- Agentic workflows: LangGraph, Swarm, etc.  
- Challenges: testing, security, shifting model behaviors  

---

## V. Role Reimagined: Who Is a Software Engineer Now?

- Builders → Translators  
- Hybrid roles emerge (prompt engineers, system orchestrators)  
- Low-code doesn’t eliminate engineers — it elevates them  
- Critical thinking > Code memorization  

---

## VI. The End of \"Tech for Tech’s Sake\"

- Old mentality: \"I just code, not business\"  
- AI needs business context to generate useful output  
- Engineers must understand goals, not just syntax  

> *“In the future, the best engineers won’t just know how to code — they’ll know why the code matters.”*

---

## VII. Real-World Stories & Demos

### Before & After
- Manual setup vs. AI scaffolding  
- Senior-led vs. Copilot-enhanced collaboration  

---

## VII. Real-World Stories (cont'd)

### Case Study: GenAI-Enhanced Team

- Dashboard project  
- Used Copilot for backend + frontend generation  
- Result: 40% faster delivery, better morale, more throughput  

---

## VII. Your Story: Vibe Coding in the Enterprise

- Adapted a version of \"Vibe Coding\" using Copilot Workspaces  
- Prompting structured around business context and enterprise standards  
- Junior devs contributed to architecture with confidence  

> *“By guiding Copilot with business intent, I was co-designing, not just coding.”*

---

## VII. Highlight: Do We Care About the Code?

> *"Do we care about the code — or just the outcome?"*

- **Demo Setup:** Ask ChatGPT to generate a Python script:  
  *"What date is two weeks from the second Tuesday of next month?"*

- **Developer Instincts:** We often feel the need to:
  - Inspect the logic
  - Refactor it for style or readability
  - Validate it against edge cases

- **But in this case?**
  - We don’t care *how* it’s written
  - We care *if* it gives the right answer
  - The next time we ask, the system may write it differently anyway

> AI has already shifted part of our mindset — treating code as a temporary utility, not a permanent product.

**Implication:**
- Our relationship with code is changing
- Results are becoming more important than maintainability for one-off logic
- This challenges the core beliefs many developers hold about craftsmanship


## VIII. Preparing for the Future

- Learn prompting, system thinking, and architecture  
- Embrace cultural change: experimentation and transparency  
- Grow internal champions for AI adoption  

---

## IX. Closing: A Call to Lead

> \"AI is the runtime that is going to shape all of what we do…\" — Satya Nadella

- Will you be a passenger — or help engineer the future?  
- Start learning. Start prompting. Start leading.  

> *“The next chapter of software engineering is being written now — and we’re all holding the pen.”*
