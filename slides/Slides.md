# 2023: AI-Powered Code Completion Becomes Mainstream

- Tools like GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, and Amazon CodeWhisperer gained popularity.
- Provided developers with real-time code suggestions within IDEs.
- Enhanced productivity and streamlined the coding process.

<!-- 
Lot's of discussion - software engineering was split
Some were this is amazing and some were not
The contrairians were in full swing and compaines were concerned about data leakage, copyright infringement, and abilitiy to copyright code it generated. 

Side Note: 99.99% of code people write, is useless to others.

Many code suggestions were not great, one area that interests me at the time was the fact it was able to not just do code suggestion but was able to also complete comments
-->

# Jensen Huang - CEO NVIDIA

> "AI is not going to take your job. The person who uses AI is going to take your job."

> "You probably recall over the course of the last 10, 15 years almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you that it is vital that your children learn computer science. Everybody should learn how to program. And in fact, it’s almost exactly the opposite."

> "Software is eating the world, but AI is going to eat software."

— **Various speeches, 2023–2024**

# Dario Amodei - CEO of Anthropic

> “I think we'll be there in three to six months, where AI is writing 90% of the code.  
> And then, in 12 months, we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of the code.”   

— **March 2025**

<!-- Dario Amodei — Anthropic CEO 

Dario Amodei is the co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, an AI safety and research company best known for creating Claude, a family of large language models.

<!-- 
A bit proacative and right now I would say to use AI effectivly 
you do need a base understanding on how it works and the best
ways to get the most out of it.

I do feel very quickly some of the capabilites will become embedded
into the applications and be a bit more automatic

Like is a voice system that can determine intent and offer up suggestions to a customer service reperesentive to queue up suggestive actions

# Don’t Just Automate the Past—Reimagine the Future

> “It’s like putting a jet engine on a horse-drawn carriage. Sure, it moves faster, but you’re missing the point—the whole vehicle can be reinvented. Generative AI gives us a chance to reimagine how we deliver, not just speed up what we already do.”

<!--

**Speaker Notes:**

Corralite the early days of Agile

Too often, companies approach generative AI as a tool to accelerate old, linear processes—just plugging AI into the same waterfall pipeline: requirements, designs, coding, testing, and deployment.

But real transformation comes when we realize we can rebuild the entire vehicle, not just add horsepower to the old one.

Generative AI allows us to move to more agile, feedback-driven delivery models. We can shorten feedback loops, continuously refine requirements and implementation, and focus on outcomes over outputs.

Let’s challenge ourselves and our organizations: Instead of simply making old processes faster, how might we deliver value in entirely new ways—ways that only become possible because of AI?

# AI as a Teammate, Not a Tool

- AI isn’t replacing your team—it’s joining it  
- Like a great teammate, it doesn’t wait for instructions  
- It watches, understands, and suggests—proactively  
- But like any teammate, it still needs guidance  

> *“Think of AI as the pair programmer that never sleeps.”*

---
# Calibrated Trust Between Humans and Machines

- Trust isn’t binary—it's a spectrum  
- We must know when to rely on AI and when to verify  
- Align confidence with competence  
- Design workflows that include human-in-the-loop oversight  

> *“We don’t need blind trust—we need calibrated collaboration.”*

# Vibe Coding 
![bg right:75% fit](img/karpathy_vibecode_screenshot.png)

---

# Initial Concerns on Vibe Coding

- Do we care about the code?
- What if the code accesses sensitive data?
- Loss of architecture and design principles
- Erosion of team understanding and collaboration
- Testing becomes an afterthought
- Versioning and traceability challenges
- Skill atrophy for developers
- Risk of prompt injection or misuse


---

# Do We Really Care About the Code?

- Do we care about the code — or just the outcome?

- AI has already shifted part of our mindset — treating code as a temporary utility, not a permanent product.

- AI is already being inserted into code bases and we don't know even what it really does.

# Vibe Coding Requires Vigilance

- Vibe coding may introduce shortcuts  
- AI might pull in PII or misuse data to “get the job done”  
- Code that looks good isn’t always code that’s safe  
- Review, guardrails, and governance are non-negotiable  

> *“Just because AI *can* solve it, doesn’t mean it *should* solve it that way.”*

# The End of \"Tech for Tech’s Sake\"

- Old mentality: \"I just code, not business\"  
- AI needs business context to generate useful output  
- Engineers must understand goals, not just syntax  

> *“In the future, the best engineers won’t just know how to code — they’ll know why the code matters.”*

<!--
Simple tactical stuff I just end up doing it myself the real skill will be understanding the business 
-->

---
# Preparing for the Future

- Learn agentic systems, system thinking, and architecture  
- Embrace change: experimentation and transparency  
- Grow internal champions for AI adoption  

---

# From Asking to Advising: A New AI Interaction Paradigm

- Stop building chatbots. Start building outcomes.  
- Don’t make users *ask*—let AI *advise*  
- Systems should anticipate needs, not just respond  
- The future UX is ambient, embedded, and contextual

# Closing: A Call to Lead

> \"AI is the runtime that is going to shape all of what we do…\" — Satya Nadella

- Will you be a passenger — or help engineer the future?  
- Start learning. Start building. Start leading.  

> *“The next chapter of software engineering is being written now — and we’re all holding the pen.”*
